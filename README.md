### About me
I started with computers and electronics when I was 9 years old. Since then, I spend my time experimenting with new things, learning new technologies, and increasing my computer skills.

I also loves travelling. Since 2016, I travel with my parents across Europe, and I love it. It help me to increase my english skills.
